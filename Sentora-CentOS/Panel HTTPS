Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf and comment out the line: Listen 443 and save. Restart apache.
Simple fix based off my explaining to find Listen 443 and comment it out 
(Since it should be in your httpd-vhosts.conf from doing the Sentora apache port change).

Ensure https-vhosts.conf has 443 for panel not 80.
