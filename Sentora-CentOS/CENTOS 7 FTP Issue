Follow below the steps to download proftpd package:

Please note - Install the ProFTPd - then remove it. For some reason it worked when I did that (and the installer won't
like there already being a ProFTPd install)

    Login your server with root access
    Install EPEL
==
yum install epel-release
==
Then
==
yum install proftpd
==
    Check proftpd package with below command
==
yum info proftpd
==
Now you can install sentora on centos 7.4 without any error:

======================================================
Download the Sentora:


wget http://sentora.org/install
